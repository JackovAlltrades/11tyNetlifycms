High-performance web apps. You're looking at one right now! There are two basic concepts:

Each page of your app is a  component
You create pages by adding files to the src/routes directory of your project. These will be server-rendered so that a user's first visit to your app is as fast as possible, then a client-side app takes over
Building an app with all the modern best practices — code-splitting, offline support, server-rendered views with client-side hydration — is fiendishly complicated. This app does all the boring stuff for you so that you can get on with the creative part.

You don't need to know how to  code to understand the rest of this guide, but it will help. In short, it's a UI framework that compiles your components to highly optimized vanilla JavaScript.
